   Hi there I am Ataberk. I graduated from Konya Technical University Computer Engineering. I have been doing research in the fields of deep learning and image processing for 2 years. I am interested in studies in the defense industry and military fields. I carried out studies in the artificial intelligence laboratory established within the university. I am interested in doing research in the health field. In addition, I implemented the Alzheimer's diagnosis decision support project using artificial intelligence with my research in the field of health. I was among the finalists with this project in the Teknofest competition. Thanks to the project, I made it possible to diagnose the disease in the early stages through classification and segmentation processes. I continue my research and studies in the field of deep learning.
